        - Easy:     Can just be standard Game
        - Medium:   Every block hit, the paddle width decreases slightly
        - Hard:     Every block hit, paddle width decreases, and higher max speed
        - Insane:   Very messed up physics???

Block:
    128x32

Beatmap Save Data:

1. Primary Data Table (Name, Length, BPM)
2. Sequence (_MEASURE_TICK_ *note_pitch + note_type* _MEASURE_TICK_) // usage of measure ticks allow each BeatBlock to be understood
